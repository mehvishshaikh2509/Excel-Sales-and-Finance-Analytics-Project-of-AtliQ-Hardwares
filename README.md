# Excel Sales and Finance Analytics Project of AtliQ Hardwares 

## Project objective -
AtliQ Hardware, a top hardware company specializing in PCs, Printers, Mouse, and Computers worldwide, needs to boost sales and improve net gross margins and Profits.

Now Sales director doesn't just want the reports or Excel files from different regional managers because there are a lot of Excel files and from these reports, potential insights will not come out, so in that case a Data Analyst plays a vital role.

# My Goal as a Data Analyst-
This project tackles analyzing a huge dataset with over half a million unorganized sales records, requiring a lot of effort to organize (ETL). The goal is to find important insights to help AtliQ hardware make smart decisions and track key performance indicators (KPIs). The main aim is to make big improvements in how well the company does, especially in net sales and net gross margin.

# Task Performed and Insights -
Project 1: Sales Analysis
Made a detailed report on customer performance to understand how well they are doing throughout the years. This helps Atliq to keep an eye on their customer sales also how much discounts they should give to the customers.

# Project Details
In this project, I've crafted a sales report using Excel's powerful pivot tables. This report empowers businesses to optimize customer discounts, streamline negotiations, and identify growth opportunities in new markets.

Throughout the journey, I've mastered key skills:

⦁ Leveraging pivot tables for insightful analysis
⦁ Harnessing Power Query to clean up data effectively
⦁ Navigating basic DAX formulas for data manipulation
⦁ Enhancing data presentation with Conditional Formatting
⦁ Elevating the visual appeal of reports
⦁ Deepening understanding of crucial sales metrics
Ultimately, this project is about arming businesses with the tools and knowledge to monitor sales, drive improvements, and seize new growth prospects. By dissecting sales data, businesses can pave their path to success in a dynamic market landscape.
