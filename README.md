# My Goal as a Data Analyst-
This project tackles analyzing a huge dataset with over half a million unorganized sales records, requiring a lot of effort to organize (ETL). The goal is to find important insights to help AtliQ hardware make smart decisions and track key performance indicators (KPIs). The main aim is to make big improvements in how well the company does, especially in net sales and net gross margin.

# Task Performed and Insights -
Project 1: Sales Analysis
- Made a detailed report on customer performance. Compared to how well they are doing throughout the years, also are they able to achieve the target or not? This helps Atliq to keep an eye on their customer sales also how much discounts they should give to the customers. Also made a market performance vs target report which helps to understand in which country or market AtliQ doing business well and in which country they don't.

# Project Details 
In this project, I've crafted a sales report using Excel's powerful pivot tables. This report empowers businesses to optimize customer discounts, streamline negotiations, and identify growth opportunities in new markets.

Throughout the journey, I've mastered key skills:

- Leveraging pivot tables for insightful analysis
- Harnessing Power Query to clean up data effectively
- Navigating basic DAX formulas for data manipulation
- Enhancing data presentation with Conditional Formatting
- Elevating the visual appeal of reports
- Deepening understanding of crucial sales metrics
Ultimately, this project is about arming businesses with the tools and knowledge to monitor sales, drive improvements, and seize new growth prospects. By dissecting sales data, businesses can pave their path to success in a dynamic market landscape.
